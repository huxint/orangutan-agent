# Orangutan

C++26 agent runtime. Build the smallest complete provider/tool/memory loop, then
extend it through the same contracts. Prefer value transformations and explicit
effect boundaries. Preserve user data; delete replaced code and stale documents.

## Workflow

1. Read [STATUS](docs/STATUS.md), [ROADMAP](docs/ROADMAP.md) and the
   [architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md), then the relevant contract below.
2. Scope a complete slice. Large changes need a checked-in
   [plan](docs/PLANS_GUIDE.md) before implementation.
3. Follow [critical rules](docs/rules/critical-rules.md) and the
   [compile budget](docs/rules/compile-budget.md).
4. Verify affected behavior, run its build/tests and `make ci`, then commit.
5. Update the document that owns any changed contract. Git owns history;
   [docs-in-sync](docs/rules/docs-in-sync.md) defines the rule.

Runtime prompt bytes follow `prompt-design.md`; this file routes development work.

## Commands

```sh
xmake f -y -m release
xmake build -j4
xmake test -j4
make ci
```

`make ci` checks repository contracts and hygiene; it does not build C++.
Use `xmake build test-<lib>` and `xmake run test-<lib>` while iterating.
