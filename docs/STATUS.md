## Snapshot

- **Slice:** 248 (`xmake run orangutan -- --help` reports slice 248)
- **Last completed history:**
  [`histories/2026-06/20260615-2300-oran-desktop-slice-a.md`](histories/2026-06/20260615-2300-oran-desktop-slice-a.md)
- **Active exec-plans:**
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md)
    — Slice A (Slint packaging + gated skeleton window) landed in slice 248;
    Slice B (`web`→`desktop` config migration) is next, then C/D (bridge + chat
    tracer).
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md)
    — remains active, but its next gate is externally blocked on real QQ
    credentials plus a sendable operator conversation; it was spun off from the
    completed channel-ingress plan
    ([`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md)).
- **Latest completed slice:** slice 248 ships Desktop App **Slice A** — the first
  `oran-desktop` slice. A custom `slint` package consumes the official prebuilt
  C++ binary release (v1.16.1, sha256-pinned; no Rust toolchain), a new `--desktop`
  build option (default off) gates the Slint UI shell + a `.slint`→C++ codegen
  rule, and the always-built `oran-desktop` bridge surface
  (`desktop::gui_compiled()`) plus `test-desktop` compile in every build.
  `orangutan --desktop` opens a skeleton window in `--desktop=y` builds and errors
  with "rebuild with `--desktop=y`" otherwise. Verified both paths: default build
  green + `test-desktop` passes + graceful error; gated build runs codegen,
  compiles the shell, links `libslint_cpp.so`, and `test-desktop` passes. The
  skeleton window launches: `orangutan --desktop` runs the Slint event loop on
  WSLg/Xwayland under both the default and `winit-software` renderers with no
  backend/font errors.
- **Next intended slice:** Desktop **Slice B** — the `web` → `desktop` config
  migration: replace `oran-config::WebConfig` with
  `DesktopConfig{enabled,theme,reduce_motion}` (+ `parse_desktop`,
  `config.example.json`, `tests/config`, drop the bootstrap `web=` summary line),
  clearing the 2026-06-06 tech-debt row. Slices C/D (bridge + view-model, then the
  end-to-end chat tracer) follow. QQ-port 4b-ii remains waiting on real QQ
  credentials and an operator conversation.
- **Cross-track progress:** [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — per-track frontier,
  next step, and pre-dependencies.

## Open Tech-Debt Rows

Lifted from [`exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`](exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md).
Closed entries do *not* live here — the tracker is canonical.

- 2026-05-26 — Deep-review backlog `review/deep-2026-05-26`: slices 113 and
  114 absorbed the high/medium bullets and most low-severity items.
  Remaining: a future regression test for the oran-io singleflight
  leader-cancel + cross-executor-wake fix; rebench any cache stat consumers
  that previously read `evictions_bytes` / `evictions_lru` after
  invalidations now that those evictions move to
  `EvictionReason::invalidated` (no callers do today, but a future
  observability consumer should be aware).
- 2026-05-21 — Second deep-review follow-up
  `review/deep-2026-05-21-followup`: slices 151–153 closed the config
  strictness sweep, redacted mutation hook payloads, and atomic-write
  durability. Remaining: CI xmake/test wiring after reference hardware is
  provisioned.
- 2026-05-21 — Deep-review backlog: slices 31–36, 60, 115, and 154–196
  absorbed the ranked items (see the tracker for the per-slice map).
  Remaining: sqlite-vec corpus numbers, embedding/vector ownership, and
  hybrid ranking policy/wiring stay grouped P1/P2/P3 in the tracker.
- 2026-05-20 — `scripts/check-compile-budget.sh` exists and works (slice 28)
  but is not wired into `scripts/ci.sh`. Gated on CI provisioning xmake on
  the documented reference hardware (8-core / NVMe / native Linux);
  otherwise the gate fires on environmental drift, not real regressions.
- 2026-05-17 — `FileSearch` does not yet ship ripgrep-class optimisations
  (mmap, extension-based binary skip, multi-threaded walk).
  Adequate at slice 20 (~27 µs / 4-file tree) but 3-10× slower than a tuned
  scanner on repo-scale inputs. Re-bench once `oran-agent` produces a real
  workload measurement.
- 2026-05-14 — Generated `docs/generated/config.schema.json` not yet
  implemented.
- 2026-05-14 — bench A-vs-B scenarios listed in
  `bench/<lib>/README.md` are placeholders.
- 2026-06-06 — Desktop: Slice A (slice 248) built the gated `oran-desktop` Slint
  shell + always-built bridge surface and pinned Slint at `1.16.1`. Still open:
  the `web` → `desktop` config-block migration (`WebConfig` → `DesktopConfig`),
  scheduled as Slice B.

## How To Update

1. The slice that lands a behavior change writes its history file.
2. The **same commit** updates this file: bump `Slice`, point
   `Last completed history` at the new file, refresh
   `Active exec-plans` (paths or `none` + reason — see
   [`PLANS_GUIDE.md`](PLANS_GUIDE.md) "When NOT To Create A Plan"),
   replace `Latest completed slice` / `Next intended slice` with the new
   frontier (move the old text nowhere — `histories/` already records it),
   refresh the test/assertion counts in "Latest Library Surfaces",
   and re-sync the tech-debt list from
   `exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
3. If the slice moved a track's frontier, refresh that track's row in
   [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) in the same commit.
4. `scripts/check-status-fresh.sh` fails the build if `STATUS.md`'s
   `Last completed history` pointer is older than the newest file under
   `docs/histories/`.
