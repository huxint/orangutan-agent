## Snapshot

- **Slice:** 259 (`xmake run orangutan -- --help` reports slice 259)
- **Last completed history:**
  [`histories/2026-06/20260626-1446-serve-channel-conversation-dispatch.md`](histories/2026-06/20260626-1446-serve-channel-conversation-dispatch.md)
- **Active exec-plans:**
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md)
    — the only active plan; its next gate is externally blocked on real QQ
    credentials plus a sendable operator conversation. It was spun off from the
    completed channel-ingress plan
    ([`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md)).
  - *Recently completed:* the runtime-service-owner plan closed 2026-06-20
    (slices 253–255 — `--serve` watcher + automation loop + scheduler idle-lock
    reaping; ROADMAP Dependency Frontier #2) and moved to
    [`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-18-runtime-service-owner.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-18-runtime-service-owner.md).
    The desktop chat-tracer plan closed 2026-06-16
    ([`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md)).
- **Latest completed slice:** slice 259 hardens configured channel ingress under
  `orangutan --serve` with a per-channel+conversation dispatcher. The channel
  concern still pumps configured adapters into `ChannelManager`, but the dispatch
  side now assigns each inbound message to a bounded worker queue keyed by
  `(channel_id, conversation_id)`: one conversation's messages run in order, while
  a slow conversation no longer blocks unrelated conversations. The slice keeps
  `oran-channel` caller-owned, preserves the slice-258 `channel:<channel_id>`
  triggered automation producer, and uses explicit child cancellation plus a
  non-awaiting completion counter so shutdown still drains spawned workers before
  returning. Per-message deadlines, idle worker eviction, per-agent strand
  splitting, webhook ingress, and concrete automation notifier routing remain
  open. `test-bootstrap` 178 cases / 1733 assertions; focused
  `[serve][channels][ordering]` coverage passed; full `xmake test` 19/19 and
  `make ci` passed.
- **Next intended slice:** continue generic channel hardening by adding
  per-message deadlines and/or idle eviction for the new conversation workers, or
  split the routed agent path onto per-agent strands where the service-level
  strand is still too coarse. Other viable follow-ups are the webhook
  adapter/producer path for non-chat triggers, concrete automation notifier
  routing, or QQ-port milestone 4b-ii once real QQ credentials and an operator
  conversation exist.
- **Cross-track progress:** [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — per-track frontier,
  next step, and pre-dependencies.

## Open Tech-Debt Rows

Lifted from [`exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`](exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md).
Closed entries do *not* live here — the tracker is canonical.

- 2026-05-26 — Deep-review backlog `review/deep-2026-05-26`: slices 113 and
  114 absorbed the high/medium bullets and most low-severity items.
  Remaining: a future regression test for the oran-io singleflight
  leader-cancel + cross-executor-wake fix; rebench any cache stat consumers
  that previously read `evictions_bytes` / `evictions_lru` after
  invalidations now that those evictions move to
  `EvictionReason::invalidated` (no callers do today, but a future
  observability consumer should be aware).
- 2026-05-21 — Second deep-review follow-up
  `review/deep-2026-05-21-followup`: slices 151–153 closed the config
  strictness sweep, redacted mutation hook payloads, and atomic-write
  durability. Remaining: CI xmake/test wiring after reference hardware is
  provisioned.
- 2026-05-21 — Deep-review backlog: slices 31–36, 60, 115, and 154–196
  absorbed the ranked items (see the tracker for the per-slice map).
  Remaining: sqlite-vec corpus numbers, embedding/vector ownership, and
  hybrid ranking policy/wiring stay grouped P1/P2/P3 in the tracker.
- 2026-05-20 — `scripts/check-compile-budget.sh` exists and works (slice 28)
  but is not wired into `scripts/ci.sh`. Gated on CI provisioning xmake on
  the documented reference hardware (8-core / NVMe / native Linux);
  otherwise the gate fires on environmental drift, not real regressions.
- 2026-05-17 — `FileSearch` does not yet ship ripgrep-class optimisations
  (mmap, extension-based binary skip, multi-threaded walk).
  Adequate at slice 20 (~27 µs / 4-file tree) but 3-10× slower than a tuned
  scanner on repo-scale inputs. Re-bench once `oran-agent` produces a real
  workload measurement.
- 2026-05-14 — Generated `docs/generated/config.schema.json` not yet
  implemented.
- 2026-05-14 — bench A-vs-B scenarios listed in
  `bench/<lib>/README.md` are placeholders.

## How To Update

1. The slice that lands a behavior change writes its history file.
2. The **same commit** updates this file: bump `Slice`, point
   `Last completed history` at the new file, refresh
   `Active exec-plans` (paths or `none` + reason — see
   [`PLANS_GUIDE.md`](PLANS_GUIDE.md) "When NOT To Create A Plan"),
   replace `Latest completed slice` / `Next intended slice` with the new
   frontier (move the old text nowhere — `histories/` already records it),
   refresh the test/assertion counts in "Latest Library Surfaces",
   and re-sync the tech-debt list from
   `exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
3. If the slice moved a track's frontier, refresh that track's row in
   [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) in the same commit.
4. `scripts/check-status-fresh.sh` fails the build if `STATUS.md`'s
   `Last completed history` pointer is older than the newest file under
   `docs/histories/`.
