## Snapshot

- **Slice:** 251 (`xmake run orangutan -- --help` reports slice 251)
- **Last completed history:**
  [`histories/2026-06/20260616-1448-async-runtime-start-desktop-session.md`](histories/2026-06/20260616-1448-async-runtime-start-desktop-session.md)
- **Active exec-plans:**
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-14-oran-desktop-chat-tracer.md)
    — Slices A (Slint packaging + skeleton window, slice 248), B
    (`web`→`desktop` config migration, slice 249), and C (always-built bridge +
    view-model, slice 250) landed; slice 251 adds the always-built Slice-D core
    (`async::Runtime::start()` + `run_chat_session`); the gated Slint shell
    completing Slice D (chat tracer end-to-end) is next.
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md)
    — remains active, but its next gate is externally blocked on real QQ
    credentials plus a sendable operator conversation; it was spun off from the
    completed channel-ingress plan
    ([`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md)).
- **Latest completed slice:** slice 251 lands the always-built **Slice D core**.
  `async::Runtime::start()` spawns the io workers and returns (vs the blocking
  `run()`), so the runtime can run alongside a foreign event loop — the Slint
  desktop shell — while keeping threads inside `Runtime` (A3); `run()`/`start()`
  share one idle→running→stopped state machine. `desktop::run_chat_session` is
  the runtime-side session loop (take `next_prompt` → run the embedder's
  `TurnRunner` streaming into the bridge sink → repeat until input closes), with
  a fresh per-turn `begin_turn()` cancellation slot so a stop ends one turn and
  `request_stop()` posting its emit onto the runtime executor. A root-cause fix
  made `ChatBridge::close()` input-only so a final turn's deltas stay drainable.
  All pure C++ — no Slint — test-first: `test-async` **16 cases / 83 assertions**,
  `test-desktop` **17 / 70**.
- **Next intended slice:** Desktop **Slice D** completion — the gated Slint chat
  UI (input, live transcript, stop) bound to the `ChatBridge`, plus the
  `orangutan --desktop` launch wiring config→runtime+provider (scripted
  `FakeProvider` fallback) + the `TurnRunner` adapting `AgentPromptRunner`,
  calling `Runtime::start()` and co-spawning `run_chat_session`. Satisfies spec
  0007 acceptance criteria 1–3; manual `--desktop=y` run recorded. QQ-port 4b-ii
  remains waiting on real QQ credentials and an operator conversation.
- **Cross-track progress:** [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — per-track frontier,
  next step, and pre-dependencies.

## Open Tech-Debt Rows

Lifted from [`exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`](exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md).
Closed entries do *not* live here — the tracker is canonical.

- 2026-05-26 — Deep-review backlog `review/deep-2026-05-26`: slices 113 and
  114 absorbed the high/medium bullets and most low-severity items.
  Remaining: a future regression test for the oran-io singleflight
  leader-cancel + cross-executor-wake fix; rebench any cache stat consumers
  that previously read `evictions_bytes` / `evictions_lru` after
  invalidations now that those evictions move to
  `EvictionReason::invalidated` (no callers do today, but a future
  observability consumer should be aware).
- 2026-05-21 — Second deep-review follow-up
  `review/deep-2026-05-21-followup`: slices 151–153 closed the config
  strictness sweep, redacted mutation hook payloads, and atomic-write
  durability. Remaining: CI xmake/test wiring after reference hardware is
  provisioned.
- 2026-05-21 — Deep-review backlog: slices 31–36, 60, 115, and 154–196
  absorbed the ranked items (see the tracker for the per-slice map).
  Remaining: sqlite-vec corpus numbers, embedding/vector ownership, and
  hybrid ranking policy/wiring stay grouped P1/P2/P3 in the tracker.
- 2026-05-20 — `scripts/check-compile-budget.sh` exists and works (slice 28)
  but is not wired into `scripts/ci.sh`. Gated on CI provisioning xmake on
  the documented reference hardware (8-core / NVMe / native Linux);
  otherwise the gate fires on environmental drift, not real regressions.
- 2026-05-17 — `FileSearch` does not yet ship ripgrep-class optimisations
  (mmap, extension-based binary skip, multi-threaded walk).
  Adequate at slice 20 (~27 µs / 4-file tree) but 3-10× slower than a tuned
  scanner on repo-scale inputs. Re-bench once `oran-agent` produces a real
  workload measurement.
- 2026-05-14 — Generated `docs/generated/config.schema.json` not yet
  implemented.
- 2026-05-14 — bench A-vs-B scenarios listed in
  `bench/<lib>/README.md` are placeholders.

## How To Update

1. The slice that lands a behavior change writes its history file.
2. The **same commit** updates this file: bump `Slice`, point
   `Last completed history` at the new file, refresh
   `Active exec-plans` (paths or `none` + reason — see
   [`PLANS_GUIDE.md`](PLANS_GUIDE.md) "When NOT To Create A Plan"),
   replace `Latest completed slice` / `Next intended slice` with the new
   frontier (move the old text nowhere — `histories/` already records it),
   refresh the test/assertion counts in "Latest Library Surfaces",
   and re-sync the tech-debt list from
   `exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
3. If the slice moved a track's frontier, refresh that track's row in
   [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) in the same commit.
4. `scripts/check-status-fresh.sh` fails the build if `STATUS.md`'s
   `Last completed history` pointer is older than the newest file under
   `docs/histories/`.
