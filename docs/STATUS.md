## Snapshot

- **Slice:** 237 (`xmake run orangutan -- --help` reports slice 237)
- **Last completed history:**
  [`histories/2026-06/20260614-1523-channel-qq-real-smoke-gate.md`](histories/2026-06/20260614-1523-channel-qq-real-smoke-gate.md)
- **Active exec-plans:**
  - [`exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md)
    — the current main line; spun off from the completed channel-ingress
    plan ([`exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md`](exec-plans/completed/2026-06-09-channel-ingress-and-adapters.md)).
- **Latest completed slice:** slice 237 ships QQ-port milestone 4b-i: an
  executable real-credential smoke gate for the registered QQ path. Enabled
  `--channel_qq=y` `test-bootstrap` builds now include a hidden
  `[.][manual][channel-qq]` case that requires `ORAN_TEST_QQ_REAL_SMOKE=1` and
  QQ smoke env vars, then drives the same registered path against real QQ:
  bootstrap registration, `ChannelManager::start_all`, one operator message
  via `receive_one`, routed prompt dispatch with a deterministic fake provider
  reply, trace/audit observation, passive QQ send, and shutdown. Ordinary CI
  remains secret-free/network-free because the case is hidden by default; when
  explicitly selected without opt-in or credentials, it returns a no-op success.
  The local environment has no QQ real-smoke variables, so this slice does not
  claim the real smoke passed and `channel_qq` remains default-off. Focused
  results remain: `test-config` **55 cases / 519
  assertions**, default `test-bootstrap` **146 cases / 1312 assertions**,
  gated `test-bootstrap` **148 cases / 1352 assertions**, `test-channel`
  **25 cases / 191 assertions**, and gated `test-channel-qq` **55 cases / 344
  assertions**.
- **Next intended slice:** QQ-port milestone 4b-ii — run the hidden real QQ
  smoke gate with real credentials and record the result before considering
  `channel_qq` default-on
  ([`exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md`](exec-plans/active/2026-06-10-channel-qq-port.md)).
- **Cross-track progress:** [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — per-track frontier,
  next step, and pre-dependencies.

## Open Tech-Debt Rows

Lifted from [`exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`](exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md).
Closed entries do *not* live here — the tracker is canonical.

- 2026-05-26 — Deep-review backlog `review/deep-2026-05-26`: slices 113 and
  114 absorbed the high/medium bullets and most low-severity items.
  Remaining: a future regression test for the oran-io singleflight
  leader-cancel + cross-executor-wake fix; rebench any cache stat consumers
  that previously read `evictions_bytes` / `evictions_lru` after
  invalidations now that those evictions move to
  `EvictionReason::invalidated` (no callers do today, but a future
  observability consumer should be aware).
- 2026-05-21 — Second deep-review follow-up
  `review/deep-2026-05-21-followup`: slices 151–153 closed the config
  strictness sweep, redacted mutation hook payloads, and atomic-write
  durability. Remaining: CI xmake/test wiring after reference hardware is
  provisioned.
- 2026-05-21 — Deep-review backlog: slices 31–36, 60, 115, and 154–196
  absorbed the ranked items (see the tracker for the per-slice map).
  Remaining: sqlite-vec corpus numbers, embedding/vector ownership, and
  hybrid ranking policy/wiring stay grouped P1/P2/P3 in the tracker.
- 2026-05-20 — `scripts/check-compile-budget.sh` exists and works (slice 28)
  but is not wired into `scripts/ci.sh`. Gated on CI provisioning xmake on
  the documented reference hardware (8-core / NVMe / native Linux);
  otherwise the gate fires on environmental drift, not real regressions.
- 2026-05-17 — `file.search` does not yet ship ripgrep-class optimisations
  (mmap, extension-based binary skip, multi-threaded walk).
  Adequate at slice 20 (~27 µs / 4-file tree) but 3-10× slower than a tuned
  scanner on repo-scale inputs. Re-bench once `oran-agent` produces a real
  workload measurement.
- 2026-05-14 — Generated `docs/generated/config.schema.json` not yet
  implemented.
- 2026-05-14 — bench A-vs-B scenarios listed in
  `bench/<lib>/README.md` are placeholders.
- 2026-06-06 — Frontend stack choice for the desktop app shell is settled
  (Slint); the `oran-desktop` library and the `web` → `desktop` config-block
  migration are still open.

## How To Update

1. The slice that lands a behavior change writes its history file.
2. The **same commit** updates this file: bump `Slice`, point
   `Last completed history` at the new file, refresh
   `Active exec-plans` (paths or `none` + reason — see
   [`PLANS_GUIDE.md`](PLANS_GUIDE.md) "When NOT To Create A Plan"),
   replace `Latest completed slice` / `Next intended slice` with the new
   frontier (move the old text nowhere — `histories/` already records it),
   refresh the test/assertion counts in "Latest Library Surfaces",
   and re-sync the tech-debt list from
   `exec-plans/tech-debt-tracker.md`.
3. If the slice moved a track's frontier, refresh that track's row in
   [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) in the same commit.
4. `scripts/check-status-fresh.sh` fails the build if `STATUS.md`'s
   `Last completed history` pointer is older than the newest file under
   `docs/histories/`.
