# Automation Runtime

`oran-automation` owns automation scheduling decisions. The shipped surface is
still intentionally narrow: deterministic periodic schedule evaluation,
long-term memory retention request planning, and a bootstrap-owned mapping from
configured retention policy into that job descriptor. It does not start
background work, open `automation.db`, publish job hooks, or call an agent loop.

## Current Status

Slice 187 adds the `oran-automation` library with:

- `<oran/automation.hpp>` as the public umbrella header.
- `<oran/automation/periodic.hpp>` for periodic cadence and memory-retention
  planning.
- `src/oran-automation/periodic.cpp` as the implementation.
- `test-automation` and `bench-automation` target parity.

The library depends only on `oran-core` and `oran-memory`. That dependency
direction is intentional: automation may plan work against memory's public
`memory::longterm::DecayRequest`, while `oran-memory` stays independent of
automation and never schedules itself.

Slice 188 consumes that boundary from bootstrap without turning bootstrap into a
scheduler. `bootstrap::longterm_memory_retention_job_from(...)` maps
`config::Config::memory().longterm.retention` into
`automation::MemoryRetentionJob`, and `RuntimeAssemblyOptions` can carry that
descriptor as `longterm_memory_retention_job`. Configured-route startup stores a
job whose `first_fire_at` is the startup decay clock plus
`decay_check_interval`, so the future periodic owner can start from the next
candidate fire after the one-shot startup pass. `RuntimeAssembly::build` stores
and exposes the descriptor but does not evaluate, persist, lease, or execute it.

## Public API

```cpp
namespace orangutan::automation {

struct PeriodicSchedule {
  core::Time first_fire_at;
  std::chrono::nanoseconds interval;
};

struct PeriodicJobState {
  std::optional<core::Time> last_fired_at;
};

struct PeriodicEvaluation {
  bool due;
  core::Time next_fire_at;
  std::chrono::nanoseconds overdue_by;
};

struct LongtermMemoryRetentionPolicy {
  std::chrono::days forget_after_unused;
  double importance_floor;
  std::size_t max_records_per_scope;
  std::chrono::hours decay_check_interval;
};

struct MemoryRetentionJob {
  std::string scope_key;
  LongtermMemoryRetentionPolicy policy;
  core::Time first_fire_at;
};

struct MemoryRetentionPlan {
  PeriodicEvaluation schedule;
  std::optional<memory::longterm::DecayRequest> decay_request;
};

core::Result<PeriodicEvaluation>
evaluate_periodic_schedule(PeriodicSchedule, PeriodicJobState, core::Time now);

core::Result<MemoryRetentionPlan>
plan_memory_retention(MemoryRetentionJob, PeriodicJobState, core::Time now);

}  // namespace orangutan::automation
```

## Periodic Schedule Semantics

`PeriodicSchedule::first_fire_at` anchors a never-fired job. Once a caller has a
`last_fired_at`, the next scheduled fire is `last_fired_at + interval`.

`evaluate_periodic_schedule(...)` is pure and caller-clocked:

- It rejects non-positive intervals with `ErrorKind::invalid_argument` and
  `field=interval`.
- It returns `due=false` when `now` is before the next fire.
- It returns `due=true` when `now >= next_fire_at`.
- It reports `overdue_by = now - next_fire_at` only for due work.

The evaluator does not skip forward over multiple missed intervals. The first
real service loop will decide whether to catch up, coalesce, or drop missed
firings based on job policy and backpressure state.

## Memory Retention Planning

`plan_memory_retention(...)` adapts the shipped long-term retention policy into
a due-only `memory::longterm::DecayRequest`:

- `scope_key` is copied from the job.
- `unused_before = now - forget_after_unused`.
- `importance_floor` and `limit` are copied from the policy.
- `decay_at = now`.
- `decay_request` is absent when the cadence is not due.

The planner validates the job before evaluating cadence:

- `scope_key` must be non-empty.
- `forget_after_unused` must be positive.
- `importance_floor` must be finite and in `[0.0, 1.0]`.
- `max_records_per_scope` must be positive.
- `decay_check_interval` must be positive.

The planner does not own a `memory::longterm::Backend`, does not publish
`memory_decay`, and does not update `last_fired_at`. Future scheduler/service
code owns those side effects after a successful run.

## Future Ownership

The next automation slices can build on this boundary in this order:

1. Add `automation.db` job/run/last-fired persistence.
2. Add the async service loop, per-agent leases, and cancellation semantics.
3. Add cron and triggered job categories.
4. Publish job lifecycle hooks and periodic `memory_decay` metadata from the
   actual periodic producer.

## Validation

Focused checks for this boundary:

```sh
xmake build oran-automation
xmake build test-automation && xmake run test-automation
xmake build bench-automation && xmake run bench-automation
```

Slice 187 reports `test-automation` at 7 cases / 40 assertions. Slice 188 adds
bootstrap coverage for config-to-job mapping and assembly descriptor storage,
reported under `test-bootstrap`. The local
`bench-automation` planning rows are:

- `automation.periodic_evaluate_1024` at about 4.84 us / 1024-job batch.
- `automation.memory_retention_plan_1024` at about 14.84 us / 1024-job batch.
